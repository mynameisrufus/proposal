# Proposal [![CI Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mynameisrufus/proposal.png)]

Simple unobtrusive token invitation engine for use with any authentication
framework. Makes no fuss and no redundant records.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'proposal'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Then run migrations to add the `proposal_tokens` table:

    $ rake proposal:install:migrations
    $ rake db:migrate

## Proposable Models

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  can_propose
end

class Project < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_proposals
end
```

## Making Proposals

For a basic proposal to the application you simply call:

```ruby
@proposal = User.propose.to('user@example.com')
```

Or

```ruby
@proposal = @user.propose.to('user@example.com')
@proposal.proposer # => User
```

When your token is returned you need to check what to do next, for example if
the user does not exist they then need to get sent an invitation.

```ruby
@proposal = User.propose(@project).to('user@example.com')
@proposal.action #=> :invite
if @proposal.save
  @url = acceptance_url(token: @proposal)
  # send out invitation
end
```

Conversely if they are already a user then they need to get an email inviting
them or an email notifying that they have been added to something.

```ruby
@proposal = User.propose(@project).to('user@example.com')
@proposal.action #=> :notify
if @proposal.save
  @project.users << proposal.recipient
  # send out notification
end
```

Finally if the user already has an outstanding invitation they may just need a
reminder.

```ruby
@proposal = User.propose(@project).to('user@example.com')
@proposal.action #=> :invite_remind
if @proposal.reminded
  # send out reminder
end
```

All actions have convenience methods for example:

```ruby
@proposal.notify?
```

## Accepting Proposals

```ruby
@proposal = User.proposals.find_by_token 'pVBJYdr3zH4B9yXWwsmy'

@proposal.accepted? #= false
@proposal.expired? #=> false
@proposal.acceptable? #=> true

if @proposal.accept!
  @proposal.resource.users << @proposal.recipient
end
```

## Proposal Arguments

You may need to store custom arguments such as the role a user may get upon
acceptance. It also has a validator that takes an array, hash or proc.

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  can_propose expects: :role
end

@proposal = User.propose.with(role: 'admin').to('user@example.com')
@proposal.arguments # => :role => 'admin'
```

## Token Expiry

The default tokens expire in one year, however you can change this.

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  can_propose expires: -> { Time.now + 10.days }
end

@proposal = User.propose.to('user@example.com', expires_at: Time.now - 1.day)
@proposal.expired? # => true
```
